        Hello. I’m Sherif. I’m a User Experience designer driven to help companies succeed by leveraging my experience in the UX lifecycle, from discovery,
        to ideation, to design, to usability testing, and all the way to front-end development. I've built tools to help designers and developers collaborate
        and transform organizations using Agile.</p>

      <p class="p">Here’s what I’ve learnt in my 18 years in this field.

      <h2 class="h2">A Solid UX Strategy Should Be An Integral Aspect Of A Company's Roadmap. Here's Why.</h2>

      <h3 class="h3">Get Closer To Your Business Goals</h3>

      <p class="p">Are you trying to keep your existing users more engaged? Are you trying to increase revenue by adding features or building
        apps that keep the user engaged? Are you trying to increase productivity or reduce churn? Are you trying to increase revenue
        or discover pain points that are costing money and increased customer support? Are you trying to develop new features or new
        software to help Marketing achieve their goals? Are you trying to bring in more users?</p>


      <h3 class="h3">Understand Your Users</h3>

      <p class="p">It's very important to understand how users interact with your system. Your users are the lifeblood of your company. Whether
        they are your employees or your customers, how they feel affects their engagement, their productivity and their willingness
        to spend more money with your company.
      </p>


      <h3 class="h3">Strategically Allocate Resources</h3>

      <p class="p">When you're a company, your resources are limited. Developing new features or upgrading existing ones And hiring additional
        resources costs money and time. UX helps to understand where those resources can be best allocating by understanding how users
        interact with your software or system and how that affects engagement, profits and other factors.
